How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea, but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He
Could
Just
Be
Gone
He
Would just
Sail on
He'll just sail on
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold,
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost,
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you,
When it's me I can't forgive?
These days drift on inside a fog,
It's thick and suffocating
He's seeking life
Outside it's hell
Inside intoxicating
He's run aground
Like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast
Down with his ship
Fading in the shadows
Now
Castaway
They've
All gone
Away
They've gone away
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold,
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you?
When it's me I can't forgive?
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me
Why can't I forgive me?
Set sail to sea, but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
So how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?
