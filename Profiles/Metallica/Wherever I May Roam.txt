And the road becomes my bride
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond, call me what you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere, anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah
And the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone, I ask no one
And my ties are severed clean
Less I have, the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond, call me what you will
Yeah, you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere, anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah, yeah
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere, anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, I said
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere, anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lie, but still I roam yeah, yeah
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam (roam)
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam yeah
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander
Wherever I may roam yeah, yeah
Wherever I may roam yeah, yeah
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
