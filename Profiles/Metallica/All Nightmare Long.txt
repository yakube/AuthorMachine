One, two
Luck runs out
Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction
Feel it burn
Still life, incarnation
Still life, infamy
Hallucination, heresy
Still you run
What's to come?
What's to be?
'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs
And you crawl back in but your luck runs out
One, two
Luck runs out
The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide
But will be found
Release your grip without a sound
Still life, immolation
Still life, infamy
Hallucination, heresy
Still you run
What's to come?
What's to be?
'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs
And you crawl back in but your luck runs out
One, two, three, four
Then you crawl back in
Into your obsession
Never to return
This is your confession
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs
And you crawl back in but your luck runs out
Your luck runs out!
