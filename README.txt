Title 17 of the United States Code defines Fair Use in the following way:

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a
copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords
or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism,
comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use),
scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining
whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to
be considered shall include—
(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
20 Copyright Law of the United States
§108 Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if
such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors

This program is strictly not for profit and is distributed freely. All included works have been obtained from either the Gutenberg Project, Wikipedia, publicly viewable social media posts from elected officials, or as the top result of a Google search of the format "[Song_Name] lyrics" or "[Song_Name] lyrics [Band_Name]". These song lyrics, while undisputably a major constituent of copyrighted work, do not in and of themselves pose any form of legitimate economic threat against their respective artists when used in this setting. Furthermore, if it were the case that publicly viewable and copyably song lyrics were deemed unlawful or unethical, the larger perpetrator by far would be lyric hosting websites that display on Google search results such as Musixmatch, Genius.com, LyricsFreak, AZLyrics, and so on. Users are expected and encouraged to credit artists, authors, and poets, whenever they are invoked, through the use of a "Profile" system which labels and categorizes content.
